////// Debugging Report for Animation function //////
// Root Bug
// Interval variable calulated wrong, resulting in a negative value,
// thus causing wait, move and fade in/out periods to either be 0 or causing SKAction functions to not work at all

find out why files can't be read

alter and clean animation algorithm so it listens for T instead of single enemy, single allies, etc and U instead of user

have animation function parse damage/healing value as a parameter
have animation function alter damage values based on keyword mod's percentage in texture value
